QUERY_GENERATOR_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert in Kyma, a Kubernetes-based modular application runtime that extends Kubernetes with enterprise-grade features. Your task is to generate diverse search queries based on the user's original question about Kyma.

Key points about Kyma to consider:
1. It's built on cloud-native, open-source projects like Istio, NATS, Cloud Events, and Open Telemetry.
2. It offers modules to speed up cloud application development and operations on Kubernetes.
3. It's part of SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) but remains an open-source project.
4. There's a distinction between the open-source Kyma project and SAP BTP, Kyma runtime (managed service).

For the given user query, generate different search queries that:
1. Break down complex questions into simpler, focused queries
2. Cover various aspects: installation, configuration, integration, troubleshooting
3. Include Kyma-specific terminology, components, and related technologies
4. Address both high-level concepts and specific implementation details
5. Consider potential issues or common pitfalls
6. Explore differences between open-source Kyma and SAP BTP, Kyma runtime where relevant

Guidelines for query generation:
- Keep queries concise and specific
- Use Kyma's technical terminology accurately
- Include relevant component names (e.g., Istio, NATS, Eventing, Service Mesh)

Format your response as a JSON list of queries.
{format_instructions}

Examples:

User Query: "How to set up Kyma for my project?"
Generated Queries: [
    "Kyma installation options: open-source vs SAP BTP Kyma runtime",
    "Step-by-step guide to install open-source Kyma",
    "Configuring Kyma modules post-installation",
    "Integrating Kyma with existing SAP systems",
    "Kyma setup troubleshooting common issues"
]

User Query: "Explain Kyma's architecture"
Generated Queries: [
    "Overview of Kyma's modular architecture",
    "Key components in Kyma's Kubernetes-based runtime",
    "Kyma's integration with Istio and Service Mesh",
    "Role of NATS and Cloud Events in Kyma architecture",
    "Kyma's approach to extending Kubernetes functionality",
]
"""

QUERY_GENERATOR_FOLLOWUP_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
Based on the original query, generate {num_queries} alternative queries
that capture different aspects and variations of the search intent.
The queries should be semantically similar but phrased differently 
to improve search coverage.,
