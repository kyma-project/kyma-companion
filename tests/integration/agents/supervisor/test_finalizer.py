            Stateful sets are a type of Kubernetes resource that manage the deployment and scaling of stateful
            applications. They ensure that each instance of the application has its own persistent storage and can
            handle failures gracefully. Key features of StatefulSets include:
            1. **Stable Network Identity**: Each pod gets a persistent hostname with a predictable DNS name
            2. **Ordered Deployment**: Pods are created in sequential order (0,1,2) and scaled down in reverse order
            3. **Persistent Storage**: Each replica gets its own persistent volume that remains attached even after pod rescheduling
            4. **Stable Storage**: Storage volumes persist even when pods are deleted
            5. **Ordered Rolling Updates**: Updates are performed one pod at a time in a controlled manner
            StatefulSets are ideal for applications like databases, message queues, and other stateful workloads that require
            stable network identities and persistent storage.
            A Kyma function is a lightweight, serverless function that runs in the Kyma environment. It allows you to
            execute custom business logic in response to events or HTTP requests. Functions are typically written in
            JavaScript or TypeScript and can be deployed easily within the Kyma ecosystem.
            Key features of Kyma functions include:
            1. **Event-Driven**: Functions can be triggered by various events, such as HTTP requests, messages from a
            message broker, or other events in the Kyma environment.
            2. **Scalability**: They automatically scale based on demand, allowing you to handle varying loads without
            manual intervention.
            3. **Integration**: Functions can easily integrate with other services and components in the Kyma ecosystem,
            such as APIs, databases, and external services.
            4. **Isolation**: Each function runs in its own isolated environment, ensuring that they do not interfere
            with each other.
