# Summary of previous chat:
#  - The `nginx` deployment in the `nginx-oom` namespace is unavailable due to low memory limits, resulting in insufficient replicas and a timeout while progressing.
#
# - The Pod `pod-check` in the `bitnami-role-missing` namespace is in a "Failed" state because the service account `pod-reader-sa` lacks permissions to execute `kubectl get pods`, leading to an exit code of 1.
#
# - Similarly, the Pod `pod-check` in the `bitnami-wrong-rbac-permissions` namespace also failed for the same reason, with the service account lacking necessary permissions.
#
# - The logs for both `pod-check` Pods could not be retrieved, limiting the ability to diagnose the exact cause of the failures.
#
# - To resolve the issues with the `pod-check` Pods, it is recommended to check the Role or ClusterRole associated with the `pod-reader-sa` service account for the necessary permissions.
#
# - The Pod `pod-check` in the `busybox-no-kubectl-binary` namespace is in an error state due to the absence of the `kubectl` binary in the `busybox` image, resulting in an exit code of 127.
#
# - To fix the issue with the `busybox` Pod, it is suggested to use an image that includes the `kubectl` binary or install `kubectl` in the `busybox` container.
#
# - The Pod "restapi-dc466b566-5t2jk" in the "kyma-app-apirule-broken" namespace has experienced restarts due to connection errors with the Redis service, indicating potential issues with service availability or configuration.
#
# - The `ScalingLimited` status for the HorizontalPodAutoscaler 'whoami' in the namespace 'whoami-too-many-replicas' is caused by the desired replica count being less than the minimum set to 10.
#
# - The logs of the "eventing-manager" pod contain errors related to subscription validation failures, including invalid sink URLs, empty source specifications, and namespace mismatches.
#   - expected output: None
#   - context: None
#   - retrieval context: None

The container `kubectl-container` within this Pod terminated with an exit code of 1, indicating an error occurred during its execution. The specific reason for the failure is not directly available from the Pod\'s status, and I was unable to fetch the logs for further details due to an error indicating that the previous terminated container logs were not found.\n\nThe Pod is attempting to execute the command `kubectl get pods`, which requires appropriate permissions. The Pod is using the service account `pod-reader-sa`. If this service account does not have the necessary permissions to list pods, it could lead to the command failing and the container exiting with an error.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should check the Role or ClusterRole associated with the `pod-reader-sa` service account and ensure it has the necessary permissions to execute `kubectl get pods`.',

        "content": 'To increase the memory limits for a Deployment named `nginx` in the `nginx-oom` namespace, you need to modify the resource limits specified in the container specification of the Deployment. Here\'s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Edit the Deployment**: You can use `kubectl` to edit the Deployment directly.\n\n   ```bash\n   kubectl edit deployment nginx -n nginx-oom\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify the Resource Limits**: In the editor that opens, find the `resources` section under the container specification. It will look something like this:\n\n   ```yaml\n   resources:\n     limits:\n       memory: "256Mi"\n     requests:\n       memory: "128Mi"\n   ```\n\n   Adjust the `memory` limits and requests to the desired values. For example, to increase the limit to `512Mi`, you would change it to:\n\n   ```yaml\n   resources:\n     limits:\n       memory: "512Mi"\n     requests:\n       memory: "256Mi"\n   ```\n\n3. **Save and Exit**: After making the changes, save the file and exit the editor. This will automatically apply the changes to the Deployment.\n\n4. **Verify the Changes**: You can verify that the changes have been applied by describing the Deployment:\n\n   ```bash\n   kubectl describe deployment nginx -n nginx-oom\n   ```\n\nThis will show you the updated resource limits and requests for the containers in the Deployment. Adjust the values according to your application\'s requirements and the available resources in your cluster.',

This is why the pod is not ready, as there are no replicas specified to be running.\n\nAdditionally, if you encounter issues where the Function fails to build, it might be related to the kaniko tool used for building container images. This tool can sometimes incorrectly determine that it is not running in a container, especially in certain k3d configurations. If you see an error in the build job logs like:\n\n```\nkaniko should only be run inside of a container, run with the --force flag if you are sure you want to continue\n```\n\nYou can resolve this by forcing kaniko to skip the verification using the `--force` flag. You can create an override file, for example, `my-overrides.yaml`, with the following content:\n\n```yaml\nserverless:\n  containers:\n    manager:\n      envs:\n        functionBuildExecutorArgs:\n          value: --insecure,--skip-tls-verify,--skip-unused-stages,--log-format=text,--cache=true,--use-new-run,--compressed-caching=false,--force\n```\n\nThen, deploy Kyma with this override:\n\n```bash\nkyma deploy --values-file my-overrides.yaml\n```\n\nThis should help in getting your Serverless Function pod ready if the issue is related to the build process.",
