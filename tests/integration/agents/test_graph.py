                Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying,
                scaling, and operating application containers. Originally developed by Google, it is now maintained by
                the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes provides a framework to run distributed systems
                resiliently, taking care of scaling and failover for your application, providing deployment patterns,
                and more.
                Key features of Kubernetes include:
                1. **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks**: Kubernetes can manage the deployment of changes to your
                application or its configuration, ensuring that not all instances are updated simultaneously, and can
                roll back changes if something goes wrong.
                2. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or
                their own IP address. If traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes can load balance and distribute the
                network traffic so that the deployment is stable.
                3. **Storage Orchestration**: Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount the storage system of your
                choice, such as local storage, public cloud providers, and more.
                4. **Self-Healing**: Kubernetes restarts containers that fail, replaces containers, kills containers
                that don’t respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn’t advertise them to clients until they
                are ready to serve.
                5. **Secret and Configuration Management**: Kubernetes lets you store and manage sensitive information,
                such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys. You can deploy and update secrets and application
                configuration without rebuilding your image and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration.
                Kubernetes is highly extensible and can be used to manage containerized applications across various
                environments, from on-premises data centers to public clouds.

                Kubernetes services can be of several types, each serving a different purpose. The main types of
                Kubernetes services are:
                1. **ClusterIP**: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. This type makes the service only
                reachable from within the cluster. It is the default type of service.
                2. **NodePort**: Exposes the service on each Node’s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP
                service, to which the NodePort service routes, is automatically created. You’ll be able to contact the
                NodePort service, from outside the cluster, by requesting `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.
                3. **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer. NodePort and
                ClusterIP services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created.
                4. **ExternalName**: Maps the service to the contents of the `externalName` field (e.g.,
                `foo.bar.example.com`), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up.
                These types allow Kubernetes to offer different ways to expose applications depending on the use case
                and the environment in which the cluster is running.

                A Kyma function is a lightweight, serverless function that runs in the Kyma environment. It allows you
                to execute custom business logic in response to events or HTTP requests. Functions are typically written
                in JavaScript or TypeScript and can be deployed easily within the Kyma ecosystem.
                Key features of Kyma functions include:
                1. **Event-Driven**: Functions can be triggered by various events, such as HTTP requests, messages from
                a message broker, or other events in the Kyma environment.
                2. **Scalability**: They automatically scale based on demand, allowing you to handle varying loads
                without manual intervention.
                3. **Integration**: Functions can easily integrate with other services and components in the Kyma
                ecosystem, such as APIs, databases, and external services.
                4. **Isolation**: Each function runs in its own isolated environment, ensuring that they do not
                interfere with each other.
                Overall, Kyma functions are a powerful way to extend the capabilities of your applications in a
                cloud-native environment.
