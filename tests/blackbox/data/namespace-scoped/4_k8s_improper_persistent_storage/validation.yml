    "The deployment `nginx-deployment` in the `test-deployment-4` namespace is not getting ready due to issues with its persistent storage configuration. The deployment is attempting to mount a volume using a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) named `example-pvc`. If this PVC is not bound to a PersistentVolume, the pod will not be able to start, which prevents the deployment from becoming ready.\n\nAdditionally, the deployment conditions indicate that it does not have minimum availability, likely because the pod cannot start due to the unfulfilled PVC. The deployment is marked as progressing, but it is not available, suggesting that the pods are not running as expected.\n\nTo resolve this issue, check the status of the PersistentVolumeClaim `example-pvc` to ensure it is correctly bound to a PersistentVolume. If the PVC is not bound, you may need to create a suitable PersistentVolume or adjust the PVC configuration to match an existing PersistentVolume. Once the PVC is correctly bound, the deployment should be able to start its pods and become ready.
    Here is a corrected version of the PersistentVolumeClaim:
      ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
      metadata:
        name: example-pvc
        namespace: test-deployment-4
      spec:
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
      ```"
