- description: This mock response contains a complete yaml-formatted Deployment with the correct port for liveness and readiness probes.
  scenario_id: test-deployment-5
  mock_response_content: |-
    "The deployment `nginx-deployment` in the `test-deployment-5` namespace is not getting ready due to issues with its liveness and readiness probes. Both probes are configured to check the HTTP path `/` on port `8080`, but the container is actually exposing port `80`. This mismatch causes the probes to fail, as they are trying to access a port that the container is not listening on.\n\nAdditionally, the deployment condition indicates that it does not have minimum availability, likely due to the failing probes preventing the pods from being marked as ready. The condition `ProgressDeadlineExceeded` suggests that the deployment has not progressed within the expected time frame because the pods are not becoming ready.\n\nTo resolve this issue, update the liveness and readiness probes to check the correct port, which is port `80`.
    Here is a corrected version of the Deployment:
