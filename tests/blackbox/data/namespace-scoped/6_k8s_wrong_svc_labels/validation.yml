    "The issue with your application not being reachable is likely due to a mismatch between the labels used in the Service selector and the labels on the Pods that the Service is supposed to target.\n\nThe Service `test-service-6` in the `test-service-6` namespace has a selector with the label `app: nginx`. However, if your Pods do not have this label, the Service will not be able to route traffic to them. This is a common issue when the labels on the Pods do not match the selector specified in the Service.\n\nTo resolve this issue, ensure that the Pods you want the Service to target have the label `app: nginx`. You can do this by either updating the Pods to include the label `app: nginx` or changing the Service selector to match the existing labels on your Pods. Once the labels are correctly aligned, the Service should be able to route traffic to the Pods, making your application reachable..
    Here is a corrected version of the Service:
      ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
        name: test-service-6
        namespace: test-service-6
        labels:
          app: test-service-6
      spec:
        selector:
          app: test-service-6
        ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 80
            targetPort: 80
        type: ClusterIP
      ```"
