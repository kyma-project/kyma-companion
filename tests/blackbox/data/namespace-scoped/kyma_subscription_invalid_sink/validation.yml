- description: This mock response explains that the Subscription sink URL is invalid because it does not end with the required suffix svc.cluster.local.
  scenario_id: kyma-subscription-invalid-sink
  mock_response_content: |-
    "The issue with your subscription is that the `sink` parameter is invalid.
     The `sink` URL you provided (`http://localhost:8080`) does not have the required suffix `svc.cluster.local`.
     In Kyma, the `sink` must be a valid Kubernetes Service URL that ends with `svc.cluster.local` to ensure it points to a valid service within the cluster.

     To resolve this issue, you should:
      
     1. Verify the Subscription status to check if it is `Ready`.
     2. If not `Ready`, check the exact reason for the error in the status of the Subscription.
     3. Ensure that the `sink` is a valid HTTP endpoint, such as `test.test.svc.cluster.local`.
     4. Additionally, ensure that the event type defined in the Subscription is correctly formatted.
      
     By updating the `sink` to a valid service URL in your Kubernetes cluster, you should be able to resolve the issue with your subscription.
